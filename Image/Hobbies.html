        <p>Dancing has been my cherished passion since childhood. I discovered my love for dance at a young age and began receiving professional training around 11 or 12 years old. I attended dance classes regularly until my tenth grade, around the age of 16. Dancing brings me immense joy and fulfillment as I express myself through graceful movements and connect deeply with the music. Whether it's contemporary or hip-hop, every step I take embodies my passion and leaves me with a profound sense of happiness.</p>

        <p>Reading has become a cherished hobby that unexpectedly captured my interest during my school days. While reading a chapter from my school book, a travel story caught my attention, and I discovered the joy of immersing myself in the world of words. Since then, my love for reading has blossomed. I've eagerly explored various genres, finding excitement in thrilling adventures and thought-provoking narratives. That one chapter ignited a lifelong passion for literature, continually enriching my life with new perspectives and captivating stories.</p>

        <p>Movies have always held a special place in my heart, captivating me with their storytelling and cinematic wonders. From the stunning visuals to the emotive narratives, each film takes me on a journey that leaves me in awe. Whether I'm immersed in a blockbuster or discovering hidden indie gems, the magic of movies never fails to ignite my love for this art form. The excitement of sitting in a theater, surrounded by fellow movie lovers, only enhances the experience. With each film, I find myself transported to different worlds, connecting with characters and their stories on a profound level. The power of movies to entertain, inspire, and provoke thought is an endless source of fascination for me.</p>
